                    and storage capacity, as well as specialized software and tools.</p>
                <p>The cluster is composed of thousands of interconnected computing nodes, with a variety of hardware
                    configurations and capabilities. It uses a job scheduling system called SLURM (Simple Linux Utility
                    for Resource Management) to manage and allocate computing resources to users. The cluster also
                    offers multiple storage options, including home directories, project directories, and scratch space,
                    to help users organize and store their data.</p>
                <p>The Hoffman2 Cluster is an essential resource for many research projects at UCLA, particularly in
                    fields such as bioinformatics, genomics, computational chemistry, and physics. It has been used in a
                    wide range of research applications, including molecular modeling, data analysis, machine learning,
                    and simulation studies.</p>
                <p>To use the Hoffman2 Cluster, users need to obtain an account through the IDRE website and have some
                    basic knowledge of Linux, command-line interface, and job scheduling. The cluster provides multiple
                    ways to connect and use the resources, including SSH, NoMachine, X2Go, and Jupyter Notebook/Lab.</p>
                <p>Overall, the Hoffman2 Cluster is a valuable resource that enables researchers and students to perform
                    complex computations and data analysis, and to accelerate their research projects. The cluster is
                    continuously evolving, with new hardware and software upgrades, as well as training and support
                    programs, to better serve the needs of the UCLA research community.</p>

                <h2 id="connect-cluster">Connecting to the Cluster</h2>
                <h3>First Steps</h3>
                <!-- <p>To connect to the Hoffman2 Cluster, users need to have an account with access to the cluster. This
                    section provides guidance on how to connect to the cluster using the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. It
                    explains that users can use a terminal or command prompt on their local machine to connect to the
                    cluster by typing in the command:</p>
                    <pre><code>ssh username@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu</code></pre> and entering their password
                    when prompted. The section also notes that it is recommended to use the SLURM workload manager to
                    submit and manage jobs on the cluster.</p>
                <p>Here's how to connect to the Hoffman2 Cluster:</p> -->
                <p>First, you will need to have an account with access to the cluster. If you do not have an account,
                    you will need to request access from the appropriate parties.</p>
                <p>Once you have an account, you can connect to the cluster using a Secure Shell (SSH) client. On
                    Windows, you can use a program like PuTTY, and on Mac or Linux, you can use the built-in terminal.
                </p>
                <p>To connect, open your SSH client and enter the following command:</p>
                <p>To connect, open your SSH client and enter the following command:</p>
                <pre><code>ssh username@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu</code></pre>
                <p>Replace "username" with your actual username for the cluster. You will then be prompted for your
                    password. Enter your password and press enter.</p>
                <p>If you are connecting for the first time, you may be prompted to accept the cluster's SSH key. Type
                    "yes" and press enter.</p>
                <p>Once you are successfully logged in, you will be on the login node of the cluster and ready to submit
                    jobs or run commands.</p>
                <p>It's important to note that on the Hoffman2 Cluster, it is recommended to use the SLURM workload
                    manager to submit and manage your jobs. To submit a job, you will create a script file containing
                    the commands you want to run, along with options for the SLURM scheduler, such as requested
                    resources and estimated runtime. Then you can submit the script using the <code>sbatch</code>
                    command.</p>
                <p>If you encounter any issues while connecting to the cluster or submitting jobs, please consult the
                    official documentation of the Hoffman2 Cluster or contact the cluster administrator for more
                    information and support.</p>

                <h3 id="nomachine">NoMachine</h3>
                <p>First, you will need to download the NoMachine client from the official website: <a
                        href="https://www.nomachine.com/download"
                        target="_blank">https://www.nomachine.com/download</a>.</p>
                <p>Install the NoMachine client on your local machine by following the prompts in the installation
                    wizard.</p>
                <p>Once the installation is complete, launch the NoMachine client.</p>
                <p>Click on the "New" button to create a new connection.</p>
                <p>In the "Host" field, enter <code>hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu</code> and in the "Port" field enter
                    <code>22</code>.</p>

                <h2 id="submitting-jobs">Submitting Jobs</h2>
                <p><strong>Create a job script:</strong> Before you can submit a job, you need to create a job script
                    that contains the commands you want to run on the cluster. The script should also include
                    instructions for the SLURM scheduler, such as the resources needed for the job (e.g., number of CPU
                    cores, memory, time limit, etc.) and the output and error files. You can use a text editor like
                    <code>nano</code> or <code>vi</code> to create the script file, and save it with a <code>.sh</code>
                    extension.</p>
                <p>Here's an example of a job script for a simple bash command that prints "Hello, world!" to a file:
                </p>
                <pre><code>#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --partition=general
#SBATCH --job-name=hello
#SBATCH --output=hello.out
#SBATCH --error=hello.err
#SBATCH --ntasks=1

echo "Hello, world!" > hello.txt
</code></pre>
                <p>This script requests to run on the general partition of the cluster, sets the job name to "hello,"
                    and specifies the output and error files. The script then runs the <code>echo</code> command to
                    print the message to a file named <code>hello.txt</code>.</p>
                <p><strong>Load the required modules:</strong> Before you can run the job script, you may need to load
                    any required software modules using the <code>module load</code> command. You can check the
                    available modules on the cluster using the <code>module avail</code> command, and load the required
                    modules by specifying the module name, version, and any dependencies.</p>
                <p>For example, if you need to use the Python 3.7 module, you can load it with the following command:
                </p>
                <pre><code>module load python/3.7</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Submit the job:</strong> Once you have created the job script and loaded any required
                    modules, you can submit the job to the SLURM scheduler using the <code>sbatch</code> command. The
                    <code>sbatch</code> command takes the name of the job script as an argument, and returns a job ID
                    number that you can use to monitor the job status.</p>
                <p>For example, to submit the "hello" job script, you can use the following command:</p>
                <pre><code>sbatch hello.sh</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Check the job status:</strong> You can check the status of your job using the
                    <code>squeue</code> command, which displays a list of all running and pending jobs on the cluster.
                    You can use the <code>-u</code> option to filter the list by user, and the <code>-j</code> option to
                    display the details of a specific job ID.</p>
                <p>For example, to check the status of the "hello" job, you can use the following command:</p>
                <pre><code>squeue -j JOB_ID</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Retrieve the output:</strong> Once the job has finished, you can retrieve the output files
                    from the cluster using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or the Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).
                    You can use a client such as FileZilla to transfer files, or use command line tools such as
                    <code>scp</code>, <code>rsync</code>, and <code>sftp</code>.</p>
                <p>For example, to retrieve the output file <code>hello.txt</code> from the cluster to your local
                    machine, you can use the following command:</p>
                <pre><code>scp username@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu:/path/to/hello.txt /local/destination/path</code></pre>

                <h2 id="data">Transferring and Managing Data</h2>
                <!-- <p>This section provides guidance on how to transfer and manage data on the Hoffman2 Cluster. It explains that users can transfer data to and from the cluster using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or the Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). The section also provides information on the different storage options available on the cluster, such as the home, project, and scratch directories, and explains how to manage data in these directories.</p> -->

<!-- <p><strong>Here's a guide on transferring and managing data on the Hoffman2 Cluster:</strong></p> -->

<h3 id="transfer">Transferring Data</h3>
<p>You can transfer data to and from the Hoffman2 Cluster using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or the Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). You can use a client such as FileZilla to transfer files, or use command-line tools such as <code>scp</code>, <code>rsync</code>, and <code>sftp</code>.</p>
<p>Here's how you can transfer files using the <code>scp</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>scp /local/path/to/file username@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu:/remote/path/to/destination</code></pre>
<p>This command transfers the file from your local machine to the Hoffman2 Cluster. You can also transfer files from the cluster to your local machine by switching the local and remote paths.</p>
<h3 id="manage">Managing Data</h3>
<p>It's essential to keep your data organized and backed up on the Hoffman2 Cluster. The cluster provides different storage options such as home, project, and scratch:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Home directory:</strong> The home directory is a personal directory that is backed up regularly. It has a limited amount of storage, and you should avoid storing large files or data sets in this directory.</li>
    <li><strong>Project directory:</strong> The project directory is intended for collaborative research projects and has more storage than the home directory. It is backed up once a day, and the files are accessible to all members of the project.</li>
    <li><strong>Scratch directory:</strong> The scratch directory is not backed up and is intended for temporary storage and storing large data sets. You can use this directory to store intermediate results and data files that you no longer need.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can check your disk usage and quota using the <code>quota</code> command. You can also list the contents of a directory using the <code>ls</code> command, and create new directories using the <code>mkdir</code> command.</p>
<p>For example, to create a new directory called "mydata" in your home directory, you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir ~/mydata</code></pre>
<p>You can also move files and directories using the <code>mv</code> command, copy files and directories using the <code>cp</code> command, and delete files and directories using the <code>rm</code> command.</p>
<p>For example, to move a file called <code>data.txt</code> from your home directory to the project directory, you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>mv ~/data.txt /path/to/project/directory/</code></pre>
<p>Overall, transferring and managing data on the Hoffman2 Cluster requires using tools like <code>scp</code>, <code>rsync</code>, and <code>sftp</code> to transfer files, and using commands like <code>quota</code>, <code>ls</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, <code>mv</code>, <code>cp</code>, and <code>rm</code> to manage your data files and directories. By following these steps, you can keep your data organized, secure, and accessible, and ensure that your research projects are successful.</p>

<h2 id="manage-env">Managing the Environment</h2>
<p>This section provides guidance on how to manage the software environment on the Hoffman2 Cluster. It explains that the cluster uses the Environment Modules package to manage the software environment and allows users to easily switch between different versions of software packages and libraries. The section provides an example of how to load modules using the <code>module load</code> command and notes that users can use the <code>module list</code> command to see a list of currently loaded modules.</p>
<!-- <p><strong>Here's how to set up and manage the environment on the Hoffman2 Cluster:</strong></p> -->

<h3 id="load-modules">Loading Modules</h3><p>The cluster uses the Environment Modules package to manage the software environment. The Environment Modules package allows you to easily switch between different versions of software packages and libraries.</p>
<p>Once you are logged in to the Hoffman2 Cluster, you will need to load the modules that you need to access the software and tools on the cluster. You can do this by typing the command <code>module load package_name</code> and replacing <code>package_name</code> with the name of the package you want to load.</p>
<p>For example, to load the GCC compiler, you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>module load gcc</code></pre>
<p>You can use the <code>module avail</code> command to see a list of available modules on the cluster, and the <code>module list</code> command to see the modules that are currently loaded.</p>

<h3 id="unload-modules">Unloading Modules</h3>
<p>You can also unload a module using the <code>module unload package_name</code> command. This command removes the module from your environment.</p>

<h3 id="manage-env-sub">Managing Your Environment</h3>
<p>You can create and manage your own environment on the Hoffman2 Cluster using the <code>module spider</code> command. This command allows you to search for modules, see module dependencies, and view available versions of a module.</p>
<p>For example, to search for a module, you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>module spider package_name</code></pre>
<p>To view the dependencies of a module, you can use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>module spider package_name --deps</code></pre>
<p>You can also use the <code>module save</code> command to create a module file that loads a specific set of modules. This can be useful if you frequently use the same modules for your work.</p>

<h3 id="change-mods">Changing Default Modules</h3>
<p>You can change the default modules that are loaded when you log in to the Hoffman2 Cluster by creating a module file in your home directory. This module file is called <code>~/.modules</code>, and it specifies the modules that should be loaded when you log in.</p>
<p>For example, to set the default module to load the GCC compiler, you can create a <code>.modules</code> file in your home directory with the following line:</p>
<pre><code>module load gcc</code></pre>

<h3 id="remove-mods">Removing Custom Modules</h3>
<p>You can remove custom modules that you have created using the <code>module purge</code> command. This command removes all loaded modules from your environment, including custom modules that you have created.</p>
<p>By following these steps, you can set up and manage your environment on the Hoffman2 Cluster, allowing you to easily switch between different software packages and libraries and customize your environment to meet your specific needs.</p>

<h2 id="monitor-cluster">Monitoring the Cluster Status</h2>
<p>This section provides guidance on how to monitor the status of the Hoffman2 Cluster. It explains that users can use the <code>sinfo</code> command to check the status of the cluster, including the number of jobs running, the number of nodes available, and the amount of memory and CPU time used by jobs.</p>
<!-- <p><strong>Here's how to monitor the status of the Hoffman2 Cluster:</strong></p> -->

<h3 id="check-status">Checking the Status of Nodes</h3>
<p>The <code>sinfo</code> command displays a summary of the status of nodes on the cluster. By default, it shows the status of all nodes in the cluster. The output includes the state of each node, such as "idle," "alloc," or "drain," as well as the number of CPUs, memory, and other resources available on each node.</p>
<p>To run the <code>sinfo</code> command, simply type the following command in your terminal:</p>
<pre><code>sinfo</code></pre>

<h3 id="view-job-info">Viewing Job Information</h3>
<p>You can also use the <code>squeue</code> command to view information about jobs that are currently running or pending on the cluster. This command displays information such as the job ID, user, partition, and job status, as well as the resources being used by the job, such as memory and CPU time.</p>
<p>To view information about all jobs on the cluster, you can run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>squeue</code></pre>
<p>You can also use the <code>-u</code> option to view information about your own jobs:</p>
<pre><code>squeue -u username</code></pre>

<h3 id="monitor-resources">Monitoring Resource Usage</h3>
<p>The <code>sacct</code> command allows you to monitor resource usage for jobs that have completed. This command displays detailed information about the resources used by each job, including CPU time, memory usage, and I/O operations.</p>
<p>To view resource usage for all completed jobs, you can run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>sacct</code></pre>
<p>You can also use the <code>-u</code> option to view information about your own jobs:</p>
<pre><code>sacct -u username</code></pre>

<h3 id="view-logs">Viewing System Logs</h3>
<p>Finally, you can view system logs to monitor the performance of the cluster and diagnose any issues. The system logs are stored in the <code>/var/log</code> directory on the cluster.</p>
<p>To view the system logs, you can use the <code>tail</code> command. For example, to view the last 100 lines of the messages log, you can run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>tail -n 100 /var/log/messages</code></pre>
<p>By using these commands, you can monitor the status of the Hoffman2 Cluster and track resource usage to ensure that your jobs are running smoothly and efficiently.</p>
